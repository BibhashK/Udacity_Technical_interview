Technical interview questions

Project: Answer the Following Interview Questions (6 total)
For each of the questions below, answer as if you were in an interview, explaining and justifying your answer with two to three paragraphs as you see fit. For coding answers, explain the relevant choices you made writing the code.

Describe a data project you worked on recently.
You are given a ten piece box of chocolate truffles. You know based on the label that six of the pieces have an orange cream filling and four of the pieces have a coconut filling. If you were to eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that the first two pieces you eat have an orange cream filling and the last two have a coconut filling?

Follow-up question: If you were given an identical box of chocolates and again eat four pieces in a row, what is the probability that exactly two contain coconut filling?

Given the table users:

     Table "users"
+-------------+-----------+
| Column      | Type      |
+-------------+-----------+
| id          | integer   |
| username    | character |
| email       | character |
| city        | character |
| state       | character |
| zip         | integer   |
| active      | boolean   |
+-------------+-----------+
construct a query to find the top 5 states with the highest number of active users. Include the number for each state in the query result. Example result:
+------------+------------------+
| state      | num_active_users |
+------------+------------------+
| New Mexico | 502              |
| Alabama    | 495              |
| California | 300              |
| Maine      | 201              |
| Texas      | 189              |
+------------+------------------+
Define a function first_unique that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeated (unique) character in the input string. If there are no unique characters return None. Note: Your code should be in Python.

def first_unique(string):
 # Your code here
 return unique_char

> first_unique('aabbcdd123')
> c

> first_unique('a')
> a

> first_unique('112233')
> None
What are underfitting and overfitting in the context of Machine Learning? How might you balance them?

If you were to start your data analyst position today, what would be your goals a year from now?
